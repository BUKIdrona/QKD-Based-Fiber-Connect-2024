            <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
            <p>We are excited to announce QKD Based Fibre Connect 2024, a premier workshop dedicated to exploring the latest advancements and innovations in the field of quantum communication using optical fibre technology. This workshop aims to convene leading experts, researchers, and practitioners to delve into the newest developments and applications in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and related quantum communication technologies.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The program will broaden your understanding of
                hybrid quantum systems, where classical and
                quantum mechanics integrate seamlessly. This
                comprehensive agenda is designed to equip
                participants with a deep understanding of the current
                challenges and future directions in quantum
                communications, fostering an environment ripe for
                innovation and collaboration. Whether you are a
                seasoned professional or a newcomer to the field, this
                workshop promises to provide invaluable knowledge
                and networking opportunities that will drive the
                advancement of quantum technologies. Join us for a
                series of insightful talks, technological demonstrations,
                and networking sessions with leading experts and
                researchers in the domain.</p>
